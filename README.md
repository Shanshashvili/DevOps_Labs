# **Containerization and Virtualization:**
## Docker

### Docker Labs

1. **Getting Started with Docker**
   - **Objective**: Install Docker and understand its basic commands.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Install Docker on your local machine or a cloud server.
     - Familiarize yourself with Docker CLI commands (`docker run`, `docker ps`, `docker images`, etc.).
     - Pull a simple image (e.g., `hello-world`) and run it to verify the installation.

2. **Creating Your First Docker Image**
   - **Objective**: Build a custom Docker image from a Dockerfile.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a simple web application (e.g., a Python Flask app or Node.js app).
     - Write a Dockerfile to define how the image should be built.
     - Build the image using the `docker build` command and run it.

3. **Docker Compose for Multi-Container Applications**
   - **Objective**: Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file for a simple application (e.g., a web server and a database).
     - Define services, networks, and volumes in the Docker Compose file.
     - Use `docker-compose up` to start all containers and test the application.

4. **Persisting Data with Docker Volumes**
   - **Objective**: Learn how to manage persistent data in Docker containers.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a Docker container with a database (e.g., MySQL) and configure it to use a Docker volume for data persistence.
     - Inspect the volume and verify that data persists after the container is stopped and restarted.
     - Test the application with data to ensure it is stored correctly.

5. **Networking in Docker**
   - **Objective**: Understand Docker networking concepts.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create multiple Docker containers and connect them using custom networks.
     - Explore different network types (bridge, host, overlay).
     - Test communication between containers using their service names.

6. **Dockerizing an Existing Application**
   - **Objective**: Take an existing application and create a Docker image for it.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Choose a simple application (e.g., a web app with dependencies).
     - Write a Dockerfile to containerize the application, ensuring all dependencies are included.
     - Build the Docker image and run the container, verifying that the application works as expected.

7. **Docker Swarm for Container Orchestration**
   - **Objective**: Set up Docker Swarm to manage multiple containers.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Initialize a Docker Swarm cluster and add nodes (if possible, use multiple machines or virtual machines).
     - Deploy a sample application stack using Docker Compose in Swarm mode.
     - Scale the application up or down and observe how Swarm handles load balancing.

8. **Using Docker with CI/CD Tools**
   - **Objective**: Integrate Docker with Jenkins for automated builds.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Modify a Jenkins pipeline to build and push a Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub or a private registry).
     - Set up a Jenkins job that runs tests inside a Docker container.
     - Deploy a Docker container as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

9. **Securing Docker Containers**
   - **Objective**: Learn about Docker security best practices.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Review and implement security practices, such as using non-root users, minimizing the attack surface, and scanning images for vulnerabilities.
     - Experiment with tools like `Docker Bench for Security` to assess the security posture of your Docker environment.
     - Explore Docker secrets and configuration management for sensitive data.

10. **Cleaning Up Docker Resources**
    - **Objective**: Learn how to manage Docker resources efficiently.
    - **Tasks**:
      - Use commands like `docker system prune` to remove unused containers, images, and networks.
      - Investigate ways to monitor resource usage (CPU, memory) of running containers.
      - Set up regular cleanup scripts or cron jobs to manage Docker resources.
