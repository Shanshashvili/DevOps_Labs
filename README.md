# **Version Control and Collaboration:**
## GitHub 

### GitHub and GitHub Actions Labs

1. **Getting Started with Git and GitHub**
   - **Objective**: Learn the basics of Git and GitHub for version control.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Install Git and create a GitHub account.
     - Create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine.
     - Add a simple file, commit changes, and push them to GitHub.
     - Explore basic Git commands like `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

2. **Branching and Merging**
   - **Objective**: Understand branching strategies in Git.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a new branch for a feature (e.g., `feature-branch`).
     - Make changes in the feature branch and commit them.
     - Switch back to the main branch, merge the feature branch, and resolve any conflicts that arise.
     - Use `git log` to visualize the commit history.

3. **Using Pull Requests for Code Review**
   - **Objective**: Learn how to use pull requests (PRs) for collaboration.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a new branch, make changes, and push it to GitHub.
     - Open a pull request and request reviews from team members.
     - Discuss changes in the PR comments and address feedback.
     - Merge the PR after approval.

4. **Setting Up GitHub Actions**
   - **Objective**: Automate workflows with GitHub Actions.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
     - Write a simple GitHub Actions workflow to run on every push, such as running tests or building a project.
     - Use a pre-defined action from the GitHub Marketplace (e.g., actions/setup-node or actions/setup-python) to set up the environment.

5. **Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions**
   - **Objective**: Implement CI for a project using GitHub Actions.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a workflow that runs automated tests whenever code is pushed to the repository.
     - Use GitHub Actions to run different types of tests (unit tests, integration tests).
     - Configure the workflow to send notifications (e.g., Slack or email) on success or failure.

6. **Deploying Applications with GitHub Actions**
   - **Objective**: Use GitHub Actions for deployment automation.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Set up a workflow to automatically deploy a web application to a hosting service "AWS" whenever code is merged into the main branch.
     - Use environment variables and secrets in GitHub Actions to manage sensitive data (like API keys).
     - Monitor deployment status through GitHub Actions logs.

7. **Managing Dependencies with GitHub Actions**
   - **Objective**: Automate dependency management with GitHub Actions.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a workflow that checks for outdated dependencies in your project.
     - Use an action to automatically create pull requests to update dependencies when necessary.
     - Review and merge the dependency updates.

8. **Publishing Documentation with GitHub Actions**
   - **Objective**: Automatically publish project documentation.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a GitHub Actions workflow to build and publish documentation (e.g., using Sphinx for Python projects or Jekyll for static sites) whenever changes are pushed to the `docs` directory.
     - Use GitHub Pages to host the documentation site.

9. **Creating Release Notes Automatically**
   - **Objective**: Generate release notes based on commit messages.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Set up a workflow that runs on releases to automatically generate release notes based on merged PRs or commit messages.
