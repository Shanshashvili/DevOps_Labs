# **Application Servers:**
## Apache Tomcat

### 1. **Tomcat Installation and Configuration**
   - **Lab 1: Install Tomcat **
     - Install Apache Tomcat .
     - Configure the Tomcat service to start automatically on boot (`systemctl enable tomcat`).
     - Verify the Tomcat installation by accessing the default Tomcat page via `http://localhost:8080`.
   
   - **Lab 2: Directory Structure and Configuration Files**
     - Understand the directory structure of Tomcat (bin, conf, webapps, logs, temp, etc.).
     - Examine and modify configuration files, such as `server.xml`, `web.xml`, and `context.xml`.
     - Modify server port settings in `server.xml`.

### 2. **Deploying Applications**
   - **Lab 3: Deploy a WAR File to Tomcat**
     - Download or create a sample Java web application (e.g., a simple "Hello World" application).
     - Package the application into a `.war` file.
     - Deploy the `.war` file by placing it in the `webapps` directory and verifying the deployment via the browser.

   - **Lab 4: Auto Deployment vs Manual Deployment**
     - Test both auto-deployment (dropping `.war` files in `webapps`) and manual deployment (using the Tomcat Manager GUI).
     - Configure the `tomcat-users.xml` file to enable access to the Tomcat Manager.
     - Deploy, undeploy, start, and stop applications using the Manager interface.

### 3. **Configuring Virtual Hosts**
   - **Lab 5: Setting Up Virtual Hosts**
     - Configure multiple virtual hosts in `server.xml` to host multiple web applications on the same Tomcat server.
     - Assign different domain names or IP addresses to each virtual host.
     - Set up custom contexts and document roots for each host.

### 4. **Security and User Roles**
   - **Lab 6: Secure Tomcat with User Authentication**
     - Secure the Tomcat Manager and Host Manager applications by configuring roles and users in the `tomcat-users.xml` file.
     - Assign roles such as `manager-gui`, `admin-gui`, and `manager-script` to users.
     - Test role-based access by logging in with different users.

   - **Lab 7: SSL/TLS Configuration**
     - Enable SSL on Tomcat by configuring a self-signed certificate or using a certificate from a trusted CA.
     - Modify the `server.xml` file to add a secure connector (port 8443) with SSL enabled.
     - Redirect HTTP traffic (port 8080) to HTTPS (port 8443) and verify using a browser.

### 5. **Tomcat Logging and Monitoring**
   - **Lab 8: Configuring Logging in Tomcat**
     - Enable and configure logging in Tomcat.
     - Explore and manage logs such as `catalina.out`, access logs, and error logs.
     - Modify the logging level (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR) in the `logging.properties` file.

   - **Lab 9: Monitoring Tomcat Performance**
     - Use the `manager-gui` to monitor server status, memory usage, and active sessions.
     - Configure and enable JMX (Java Management Extensions) to monitor Tomcat performance remotely.
     - Integrate Tomcat with a monitoring tool such as Prometheus or Nagios.

### 6. **Session Management**
   - **Lab 10: Session Configuration and Management**
     - Configure session management options in Tomcat.
     - Modify session timeout settings in the `web.xml` file.
     - Enable session persistence to store sessions across Tomcat restarts.

### 7. **Performance Tuning**
   - **Lab 11: Optimizing Tomcat for High Traffic**
     - Configure thread pools and connection settings in the `server.xml` file (e.g., `maxThreads`, `minSpareThreads`, `maxConnections`).
     - Tune Tomcat’s memory settings by modifying the `CATALINA_OPTS` and `JAVA_OPTS` environment variables.
     - Test performance using load testing tools like `Apache JMeter` or `ab` (Apache Benchmark).

   - **Lab 12: Enabling Gzip Compression**
     - Enable Gzip compression in Tomcat by adding a filter to the `web.xml` file.
     - Compress static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and dynamic content.
     - Verify the compression using browser developer tools or `curl`.

### 8. **Clustering and Load Balancing**
   - **Lab 13: Configuring Tomcat Clustering**
     - Set up Tomcat clustering for session replication across multiple Tomcat instances.
     - Modify `server.xml` to enable clustering and test failover using a sample web application.
     - Test session persistence by shutting down one node in the cluster and ensuring the session remains active on another node.

   - **Lab 14: Load Balancing with Apache HTTPD**
     - Configure Apache HTTPD as a load balancer for multiple Tomcat instances.
     - Use the `mod_proxy` and `mod_proxy_balancer` modules in Apache HTTPD to distribute traffic.
     - Test load balancing and failover scenarios by taking down one Tomcat server.

### 9. **Tomcat and Databases**
   - **Lab 15: Configuring Database Connections (JDBC)**
     - Set up a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and create a sample table.
     - Configure a JDBC DataSource in Tomcat’s `context.xml` or `server.xml` for the application to connect to the database.
     - Implement connection pooling using `DBCP` or `HikariCP`.


### 10. **Troubleshooting and Debugging**
   - **Lab 16: Troubleshooting Common Tomcat Issues**
     - Simulate common issues such as port conflicts, memory leaks, and high CPU usage.
     - Use tools such as `jstack`, `jmap`, and `VisualVM` to analyze Tomcat memory and thread dumps.
     - Investigate and resolve common HTTP error codes (500, 404, 503) related to Tomcat misconfiguration.
