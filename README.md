# CCNA â€“ Routing and Switching

## During my CCNA studies, I had the opportunity to engage in hands-on labs and deepen my understanding of networking concepts:

1. Configured switches, routers, and end devices using Cisco Packet Tracer and in lab environments.
2. Developed a strong understanding of networking protocols and models, including OSI and TCP/IP.
3. Explored network security fundamentals and applied LAN security concepts to protect network resources.
4. Implemented VLANs in a multi-switched environment to optimize network performance.
5. Applied Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) to prevent loops in network topologies.
6. Configured DHCPv4, SLAAC, and DHCPv6 for dynamic IP address allocation.
7. Executed WLAN configuration to support wireless networking needs.
8. Designed Access Control Lists (ACLs) to manage network traffic effectively.
9. Gained knowledge in network management and troubleshooting scenarios to ensure smooth operations.
10. Configured Single-area OSPFv2 for efficient routing within the network.
